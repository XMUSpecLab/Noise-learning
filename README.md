4. Instructions for use

## 1. System requirements
**software:**

- Python = 3.8.13

- PyTorch = 1.5

- PyCharm Community = 2022.1.3 

**Python packages:**

- scipy

- matplotlib.pyplot

- math

- random

- os

## 2. Installation guide
We recommend to use anaconda to install the python environment and relevant python packages. 

The typical install time should be around one hour.

After setup the running environment, download and unzip the code.

## 3. Demo
We have provided  Raman specra dataset for demonstrating the model inferencing.

Run the Main.Py in PyCharm you will obtain the denoised Raman spetra, and you can plot the curve in matplotlib.pyplot, Matlab, or Origin to check the spectra with and without denoising.
