4. Instructions for use

## 1. System requirements
**Software:**

-  Python = 3.8.13
-  PyCharm Community = 2022.1.3 

**Python packages:**
-  PyTorch = 1.5
-  scipy
-  matplotlib.pyplot
-  math
-  random
-  os

## 2. Installation guide
We recommend to use anaconda to install the python environment and relevant python packages. 

The typical install time should be around one hour.

After setup the running environment, download and unzip the code.

## 3. Demo
We provide  Raman spectra dataset for model inferencing.

Run the Main.py in PyCharm, you will obtain the denoised Raman spetra, and you can plot the curves in matplotlib.pyplot, Matlab, or Origin to check the spectra before and after denoising.
