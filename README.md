4. Instructions for use

## 1. System requirements
**Software:**

-  Python = 3.8.13
-  PyCharm Community = 2022.1.3 

**Python packages:**
-  PyTorch = 1.5
-  numpy
-  scipy
-  matplotlib.pyplot
-  math
-  random
-  os

## 2. Installation guide
We recommend the users to install the python environment and relevant python packages via [Anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/download). 

The typical install time should be around one hour.

After setup the running environment, download and unzip the code.

## 3. Demo
We provide  Raman spectra dataset and pretrained AUnet model for model inferencing. Users can download them in the ***master*** branch of this repository.

**Steps for runding demo:**

1. Download the pretrained AUnet model and Raman spectra dataset.
2. Set the model and test dataset path in the **config.py** script.
3. Run the **main.py** in PyCharm (or other IDEs such as Vscode, Spyder, JupyterNotebook), you will obtain the denoised Raman spetra.

The default output is *.mat file that can be directly loaded in Matlab for visualization. You can also save the results as .pyc or .txt files, and plot the curves in matplotlib.pyplot, or Origin to check the spectra before and after denoising.
